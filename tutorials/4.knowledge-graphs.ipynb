    "**What is a knowledge graph?**\n",
    "\n",
    "A knowledge graph, also known as a semantic network, represents real-world entities and their relationships. It consists of nodes, edges, and labels. Nodes can represent any entity, while edges define the connections between them. For example, a node representing an author like \"J.K. Rowling\" can be connected to another node representing one of her books, \"Harry Potter\", with the edge \"author of\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Applications of knowledge graphs**\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowledge graphs have various applications, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Search Engines: They enhance search results by incorporating semantic-search information from diverse sources.\n",
    "-  Recommendation Systems: They suggest products or services based on user behavior and preferences.\n",
    "-  Natural Language Processing: They aid in understanding and generating human language.\n",
    "-  Data Integration: They facilitate the integration of data from different sources by identifying relationships.\n",
    "-  Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning: They provide contextual information to improve decision-making."
