# Introduction

This showcases a simple streamlit module which can be used to do data annotation for files in a specific table.

Make sure to install the dependencies first with `uv pip install -r requirements.txt`

To populate the table, run `main.py`. This should generate ~20 different todos insert it into the table and mark it as unannotated. Once you've done so, you can then boot up the `annotate.py` file using the command `streamlit run annotate.py`
