# Elevating Git Practices with Cursor Rules: A New Era for Instructor Contributors

In the world of AI-assisted coding, the way we interact with version control is rapidly evolving. Many developers have embraced what Jason Liu aptly calls "vibe coding" — a more fluid, AI-assisted approach to software development. However, this new paradigm brings unique challenges, particularly when it comes to Git best practices. I'm excited to share how Instructor is addressing these challenges through the adoption of Cursor rules, and why this matters for everyone looking to contribute to the project.

## The Git Challenge in the Age of AI Coding

As Jason Liu points out in his blog post [Version Control for the Vibe Coder (Part 1)](https://jxnl.co/writing/2025/03/18/version-control-for-the-vibe-coder-part-1/), there's often a disconnect between traditional Git workflows and AI-assisted coding:

> "Imagine this: you open Cursor, ask it to build a feature in YOLO-mode, and let it rip. You feel great as you watch code materialize... until you realize you haven't made a single commit, your branch is a mess, and you have no idea how to organize these changes for review."

This scenario is all too familiar. When coding with AI assistants like Cursor, we often focus on the rapid generation of ideas and solutions, sometimes at the expense of version control discipline. The result? Massive, disorganized commits that are hard to review, integrate, and maintain.

## Enter Cursor Rules: Bringing Structure to Vibe Coding

Instructor has recently adopted Cursor rules — a powerful feature that helps standardize Git workflows directly within the Cursor environment. These rules are simple markdown files stored in the `.cursor/rules` directory that provide consistent guidance to Cursor AI when working with your codebase.

As Jason explains in [Version Control for the Vibe Coder (Part 2)](https://jxnl.co/writing/2025/03/18/version-control-for-the-vibe-coder-part-2/):

> "Add rules to `.cursor/rules` to instruct Cursor clearly and repeatedly... The real key to success with Git is much simpler: Make Small, Frequent Commits... Let Cursor Handle the Rest."

This approach perfectly balances the freedom of AI-assisted coding with the structure needed for effective collaboration.

## How Instructor's Cursor Rules Make Contributing Easier

If you're looking to contribute to Instructor, the new Cursor rules implementation will significantly improve your experience. Here's how:

### 1. Standardized Branching and Commits

The rules guide Cursor to automatically suggest proper branching strategies and commit messages. For instance, when implementing a new feature, Cursor will help you:

- Create appropriately named feature branches
- Make incremental commits with semantic commit messages
- Follow consistent formatting for PR descriptions

### 2. Streamlined PR Workflow

Instructor's Cursor rules also define best practices for creating and managing pull requests:

- Automatically formatting PR descriptions
- Including appropriate reviewers
- Using stacked PRs for complex features (as detailed in Jason's Part 2 blog post)

### 3. Documentation Integration

The rules prompt automatic updates to relevant documentation when code changes occur, helping maintain the project's excellent documentation standards.

## Getting Started with Instructor and Cursor Rules

If you're new to contributing to Instructor or using Cursor, here's how to leverage these rules effectively:

1. **Install Cursor**: If you haven't already, [download and install Cursor](https://cursor.sh/)
2. **Clone the Instructor repository**: `git clone https://github.com/instructor-ai/instructor.git`
3. **Open in Cursor**: The `.cursor/rules` directory will automatically be loaded
4. **Make your changes**: Let Cursor guide you through proper Git practices
5. **Create a PR**: Follow Cursor's guidance to create a well-structured PR

The best part? You don't need to memorize all the Git commands or project standards. The rules will guide Cursor to suggest the right approaches at the right time.

## Stacked PRs: A Game Changer for Complex Features

One particularly valuable practice encouraged by Instructor's Cursor rules is the use of stacked PRs. As Jason explains:

> "Stacked pull requests are a powerful workflow for building complex features incrementally. Instead of one massive PR, you create a series of smaller, dependent PRs that build upon each other."

This approach is especially valuable for Instructor contributors, as it allows for:

- More focused code reviews
- Easier integration of changes
- Better organization of complex features
- Clearer documentation of implementation decisions

The Cursor rules provide guidance on how to create and manage these stacked PRs effectively, taking the guesswork out of the process.

## The Human Side of AI-Assisted Contribution

Perhaps the most significant benefit of Cursor rules is how they keep the human element central to the contribution process. While AI assists with code generation and Git practices, the rules ensure that:

- Code changes remain transparent and reviewable
- Documentation stays up-to-date
- Commit history tells a clear story
- Contributors get proper credit for their work

## Try It Yourself

If you're interested in contributing to Instructor, I highly recommend giving Cursor a try. The combination of AI-assisted coding with structured Git practices through Cursor rules creates an exceptional development experience that makes contributing both more productive and more enjoyable.

The next time you want to fix a bug or add a feature to Instructor, open it in Cursor and let the rules guide you through the process. You'll find that making a PR becomes a much more streamlined experience, allowing you to focus on what matters most: writing great code.

As Jason aptly concludes: "Remember: The most important Git skill is making regular, small commits. Everything else - bisecting, stacked PRs, complex rebases - these are just tools that Cursor can handle for you."

With Instructor's adoption of Cursor rules, you can now enjoy the best of both worlds: the creative freedom of AI-assisted coding with the structure and discipline needed for effective collaboration. Happy coding!
