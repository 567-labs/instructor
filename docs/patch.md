## Support for Gemini Models

The instructor module now supports Gemini models. This includes the ability to create instructors from Gemini clients, parse responses from Gemini models, and handle responses from Gemini models. New tests have been added to ensure the correct functioning of these features. This implementation allows for a more robust and flexible instructor module that can handle a wider range of models.
