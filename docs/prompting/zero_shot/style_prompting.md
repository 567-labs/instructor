Be specific about the desired writing style<sup><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09185">1</a></sup> that you want from the model using specific instructions to the model about tone, pacing among other factors.

By giving clear directions about these stylistic elements, you can guide the model to produce text that closely matches your intended style and format.
