- When being asked to make new features, make sure that you check out from main a new branch and make incremental commits
- If the feature is very large, create a temporary `todo.md`
- And start a pull request using `gh`
- Make sure to include `This PR was written by [Cursor](mdc:https:/cursor.sh)`
- Add default reviewers:
    - Use `gh pr edit <id> --add-reviewer jxnlco,ivanleomk`
    - Or include `-r jxnlco,ivanleomk` when creating the PR
- use `gh pr view <id> --comments | cat` to view all the comments
- For PR updates:
    - Do not directly commit to an existing PR branch
    - Instead, create a new PR that builds on top of the original PR's branch
    - This creates a "stacked PR" pattern where:
        1. The original PR (base) contains the initial changes
        2. The new PR (stack) contains only the review-related updates
        3. Once the base PR is merged, the stack can be rebased onto main
