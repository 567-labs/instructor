## Description
This PR optimizes the `instructor/dsl/iterable.py` module to enhance performance, improve type safety, and enhance error handling. It addresses several areas for improvement while maintaining full compatibility with existing functionality.

## Changes
- Added proper generic type support with `TypeVar` for better type safety
- Fixed ClassVar type annotation to resolve linter errors
- Added proper type casting to ensure type compatibility
- Reduced code duplication with helper methods like `_process_common_modes`
- Improved error handling with specific exception types
- Added comprehensive docstrings with proper formatting
- Enhanced control flow with early returns and continue statements
- Implemented safer dictionary access with `get()` method
- Added better exception handling during model validation

## Testing
All tests have been verified, including:
- Basic functionality test (`test_multitask.py`)
- Streaming tests (`test_iterable_model` in various providers)
- Async streaming tests

## Benefits
- Improved robustness: Better handling of edge cases and errors
- Better type safety: Generic typing and proper casting throughout 
- Reduced duplication: Common code patterns extracted to shared methods
- Enhanced maintainability: Better documentation and clearer structure
- Performance improvements: Optimized control flow and error handling
