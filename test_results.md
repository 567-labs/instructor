# Instructor Integration Test Results

## OpenAI Integration
- **Status**: Requires API Key
- **Commands Tested**: Not verified
- **Streaming Support**: Documented support for all streaming methods
- **Required Environment Variables**: `OPENAI_API_KEY`

## Anthropic Integration
- **Status**: Requires API Key
- **Commands Tested**: Not verified
- **Streaming Support**: Documented support with noted latency considerations
- **Required Environment Variables**: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`

## Mistral Integration
- **Status**: Requires API Key
- **Commands Tested**: Not verified
- **Streaming Support**: Limited - No support for partial or full streaming
- **Required Environment Variables**: `MISTRAL_API_KEY`

## Testing Limitations
All integrations require API keys for full verification. The documentation has been updated to reflect:
1. Streaming capabilities and limitations
2. Accurate model support
3. Implementation requirements
4. Error handling recommendations

## Next Steps
To fully verify all commands:
1. Obtain necessary API keys
2. Run test suite with actual credentials
3. Update documentation based on test results
4. Verify streaming capabilities in practice

## Environment Setup
All required dependencies are installed:
- instructor[anthropic]
- instructor[openai]
- mistralai
- pytest

The `.env.tests` file has been created to track missing API keys.
